Preliminary searching shows two possible locations for setting default programmer, programmer.txt and preferences.txt. 

Comparison to DxCore shows that a default programmer isn't selected either. Arduino does have a default programmer and it seems to be selected in preferences.txt.

Reading https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/0.19/platform-specification/#programmerstxt for research. The name of the programmer might be the issue? Will look into: 

"Upload Using Programmer by defaultÂ¶
If the upload.protocol property is not defined for a board, the Arduino IDE's "Upload" process will use the same behavior as "Upload Using Programmer". This is convenient for boards which only support uploading via programmer."

I think that the issue with the default programmer being selected is the different boardID variable in boards.txt and programmers.txt. In the arduino core the boardid in boards.txt and programmers.txt is "uno". In our core, the boardid in boards.txt is "avrda" but in programmers.txt its "nedbg". I'm not sure what the reprecussions of changing that name is, so that will be wht I test next.
